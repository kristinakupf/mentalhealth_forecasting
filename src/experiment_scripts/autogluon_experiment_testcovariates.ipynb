    "https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-model-zoo.html\n",
    "\n",
    "To fit our experiment design, it may make the most sense to run models separately. This way we'll can collect all of the forecasts produced by each model type, rather than ending up with forecasts produced by different methods all being called AutoGluon. That said, if we want to treat AutoGluon as a closed method, we can (any maybe should!) do that as well, if for no other reason to highlight the power of Auto* frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to be clear, we can initially experiment with the underlying models' separately, e.g. with:\n",
    "- NaiveModel\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- TemporalFusionTransformerModel\n",
    "\n",
    "And at the end, we can consider the use of AutoGluon's presets (e.g. `'fast_training'` and `'best_quality'`) where we would just consider those to be 'techniques' themselves to compare in a special analysis to see whether AutoGluon could have just produced the best forecast on its own.\n"
