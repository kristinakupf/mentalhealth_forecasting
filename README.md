# Mental Health Service Forecasting Research Project Codebase

## Project Background

This repository is part of a research initiative aimed at developing advanced forecasting models for mental health service utilization in Ontario, Canada. The project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the demand for services offered by Connex Ontario, a critical resource for individuals struggling with mental health and addiction issues. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mental health underscores the necessity of this work, highlighting the dynamic nature of mental health needs and the importance of responsive health service planning.
